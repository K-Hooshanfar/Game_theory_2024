# Question 4: ESS and RD Equilibrium Analysis 

Considering the following payoff matrix, answer the questions below.

|   | S1  | S2  | S3  |
|---|-----|-----|-----|
| S1| 1   | 3   | 2   |
| S2| 0   | 2   | 5   |
| S3| 6   | 1   | 4   |

## Part A

Find the Nash equilibrium for this system.

## Part B

Find the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) equilibrium.

## Part C

Using the replicator dynamics model, simulate the system. This model follows the replicator dynamics equation. Determine the initial population and number of steps. Track the new population at each step.

## Part D

Using this model, analyze the conditions for the initial population leading to the replicator dynamics equilibrium.

# Question 5: Fictitious Play 

In a two-person game with two strategies, consider the following game. Assume this game is symmetric and each player finds their strategy using Fictitious Play. Write the following items using the provided formula (reply or Python):

|   | L   | R   |
|---|-----|-----|
| U | 5, 2| 0, 3|
| D | 4, 1| a, 7|

## Part A

Find the Nash equilibrium for this game when \( a = 1 \).

## Part B

Assume that the players' observations in the game are as follows, check that this game is constructed using Fictitious Play (Fictitious Play):

1. \( n = 1 => (0, 2) \)
2. \( n = 2 => (3) \)

Analyze your answer.

## Part C

Find the Nash equilibrium for this game when \( a = 10 \).

## Part D

Assume that the players' observations in the game are as follows, check that this game is constructed using Fictitious Play (Fictitious Play):

1. \( n = 1 => (0, 2) \)
2. \( n = 2 => (3) \)

Analyze your answer for the case when \( a = 10 \).
